# Photon Go

Photon Go is an auto-generated database client, which is fully typesafe, reduces boilerplate code and replaces traditional ORMs.

Currently, Photon Go is still under heavy development and in an experimentation phase, where we build specifications for the syntax and make major decisions on how the Go client will look and work. Photon Go is unstable and there is no ETA for general availability yet.
